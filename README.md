# Links Awakening in TypeScript

This is a reimplementation of Nintendos Game Links Awakening. This project currently only serves the reason to teach myself some TypeScript.

All graphics and sprites are owned by Nintendo.
The spritesheets were mostly provided by the following People:

- [Drshnaps](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/thelegendofzeldalinksawakeningdx/sheet/9445/)
